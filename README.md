## References, Documentation and Motivation

Over the **many** days of getting this off the ground, I leaned heavily on
the work and writings of others. I could not have made nearly as much progress
without example projects, blog posts and great documentation. Some that were
particularly helpful:

- [kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way][3]
- [Deploying Kubernetes on Bare Metal][4] by Layachi Khodja
- [rmb938/tailscale-cni][5]
